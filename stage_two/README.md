## Simple REST API for CRUD Operations on "Person" Resource

This is a simple REST API that allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a "person" resource. The API is designed to be flexible, secure, and capable of dynamically handling parameters such as a person's name. It is built using NodeJs, Express (framework) and MongoDB (Database). 

The endpoint should take two GET parameters and return specific information in JSON format.
